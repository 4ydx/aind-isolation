Profiling

Profiling will give you a much more detailed idea about what's going on. Here's the "instant example" from the official docs:

import cProfile
import re
cProfile.run('re.compile("foo|bar")')

	
If using cProfile there is also an option to profile the whole script and save results to a file with 
python -m cProfile -o results.prof myscript.py
snakeviz results.prof
