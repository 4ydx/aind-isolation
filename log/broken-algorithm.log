This script evaluates the performance of the custom heuristic function by
comparing the strength of an agent using iterative deepening (ID) search with
alpha-beta pruning against the strength rating of agents using other heuristic
functions.  The `ID_Improved` agent provides a baseline by measuring the
performance of a basic agent using Iterative Deepening and the "improved"
heuristic (from lecture) on your hardware.  The `Student` agent then measures
the performance of Iterative Deepening and the custom heuristic against the
same opponents.
