\begin{abstract}

Minimax alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening requires a heuristic in
order to determine which branches should be kept and which should be pruned.
Six different strategies are explored with the hope that a heuristic that outperforms
the ID Improved default heuristic can be found.

\end{abstract}

\section{Encroach The Opponent's Moves}

Attempt to create a heuristic that encourages moves that could directly conflict with
the opponents movement space.  This is, like several of the heuristics explored, is
very simplistic and, ultimately, is not very effective.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    favored = float(0)
    playerMoves = game.get_legal_moves(player)
    opponentMoves = game.get_legal_moves(game.get_opponent(player))
    for o in opponentMoves:
        for p in playerMoves:
            if o == p:
                favored += 1
            else:
                favored -= 1
    return favored
\end{lstlisting}

This doesn't appear to be significantly different from the base ID Improved heuristic 
of favoring moves that provide more moves than the opponent.

\section{Primarily Follow The Opponent}

Favor moves where the player encroaches on the opponents final move and otherwise
follow the opponent around the board.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    playerMoves = game.get_legal_moves(player)
    opponentMoves = game.get_legal_moves(game.get_opponent(player))
    if len(opponentMoves) == 1:
        for o in opponentMoves:
            for p in playerMoves:
                if o == p:
                    return float("+inf")

    playerAt = game.get_player_location(player)
    opponentAt = game.get_player_location(game.get_opponent(player))

    xDiff = playerAt[0] - opponentAt[0]
    yDiff = playerAt[1] - opponentAt[1]
    denom = float(xDiff*xDiff + yDiff*yDiff)
    if denom == 0:
        return float("+inf")
    return float(1.0/denom)
\end{lstlisting}

This strategy appears to be roughly equivalent to the default ID Improved heuristic.

\section{Results}

Keeping a close proximity to the opponent appears to be at least a break even strategy.
Given that it shows the best possible score among all heuristics I created, that is what I am going with.
I am a bit embarassed to say that I ultimately felt like I was randomly tossing attempted strategies into
a dark, bottomless pit: I am not familiar enough with this game to have an intuition for good strategies it seems.
